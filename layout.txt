Today we'll improve the layout of the shoppinglist script.

Maybe there are better ways to create a layout but that's my way:
1.) Select the size of the custom view (I usually choose iPad)
2.) When ui elements should keep there size remove the inner arrows
3.) And now I select the outer arrows (as an anchor)
4.) Check your layout and also rotate your iDevice

Okay and now in detail:
1.) Open the last layout (shoppinglist.pyui)
2.) Change the size of the custom view (i-button top-right => Size => Preset iPad)
3.) Next we adjust the ui elements
4.) TextField (new_item) => Attributes => Frame / Auto-Resizing => 
x=6, y=6, width=756, height=32, size-change only horizontal, anchor top+bottom (WLR)
5.) TextView (shoppinglist) => Atrributes => Frame / Auto-Resizing =>
x=6, y=46, with=756, height=868, size-change all directions, anchor top+bottom (WHLR)
6.) Button (add_item) => Atrributes => Frame / Auto-Resizing =>
x=338, y=922, width=90, height=32, no size-change, anchor bottom (LRT)
7.) If you changed the script name to 'layout' please also adjust your code
view = ui.load_view('layout')
8.) Run the script and rotate your iDevice

=> Please reduce the width of the TextView to 372 and add a second TextView (same size) to the left. What changes are necessary to resize them automaticly? Don't forget to add a frame for the second TextView or of course you can duplicate the old TextView.
