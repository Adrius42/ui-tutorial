UI Tutorial
===========

As you surely noticed there are two ways of writing a ui-script. If you use only a few GUI elements you might write all 
the code in your script.py, but that's not what I want to show you first. I want to show you how to use the UI design tool
to speed up the process and write only some code.

* Untitled 1 => hello world script
* hello_world_v2 => change the label every second
* shoppinglist => button, tableview and textfield use
* layout => automatic resize ui elements
* pop-over => pop-over view -> Really want to quit?
* AreYouEnabledView => advanced example with textfield_did_change, console_alert, speech, ... (written by cclauss)
* ShowTableView => directory table, empty table and table with different accessory_types/images
* MultipleViews => add and remove views/elements at run time
* MultipleViews_v2 => get the screen size / orientation // implement did_load and draw
* Webbrowser<br />
* SpecialButton => control all touch events (touch_began, _moved, _ended)
* segmented-control (written by tjferry14)
* MyImageView => view all JPGs in the current directory
* NavigationViewExample => don't forget `test.pyui` (the subview)
* SwitchViews => show and hide complex views (my own NavView ðŸ˜„). Don't forget `test.pyui` and `space.png`
