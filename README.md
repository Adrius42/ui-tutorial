ui-tutorial
===========

As you surely noticed there are two ways of writing a ui-script. If you use only a few GUI elements you might write all 
the code in your script.py, but that's not what I want to show you first. I want to show you how to use the UI design tool
to speed up the process and write only some code. Please be patient, I'm starting with the basics.

1. Untitled 1 => hello world script<br />
2. hello_world_v2 => change the label every second<br />
3. shoppinglist => button, tableview and textfield use<br />
4. layout => automatic resize ui elements<br />
5. pop-over => pop-over view -> Really want to quit?<br />
6. AreYouEnabledView => advanced example with textfield_did_change, console_alert, speech, ... (written by cclauss)<br />
7. ShowTableView => directory table, empty table and table with different accessory_types/images<br />
8. MultipleViews => add and remove views/elements at run time<br />
9. MultipleViews_v2 => get the screen size / orientation // implement did_load and draw<br />
10. Webbrowser<br />
11. SpecialButton => control all touch events (touch_began, _moved, _ended)<br/>
12. segmented-control written by tjferry14<br />
13. MyImageView => View all JPGs in the current directory<br />
<br />
