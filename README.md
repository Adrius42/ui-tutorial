ui-tutorial
===========

As you surely noticed there are two ways of writing a ui-script. If you use only a few GUI elements you might write all 
the code in your script.py, but that's not what I want to show you here. I want to show you how to use the UI design tool
to speed up the process and write only some code. Please be patient, I'm starting with the basics.

1.) Untitled 1 => hello world script<br />
2.) hello_world_v2 => change the label every second<br />
3.) shoppinglist => button, textview and textfield use<br />
4.) layout => automatic resize ui elements<br />
5.) pop-over => pop-over view -> Really want to quit?<br />
