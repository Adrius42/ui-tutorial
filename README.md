UI Tutorial
===========

As you surely noticed there are two ways of writing a ui-script. If you use only a few GUI elements you might write all 
the code in your script.py, but that's not what I want to show you first. I want to show you how to use the UI design tool
to speed up the process and write only some code.

+ **Untitled 1.py** - hello world script
+ **hello_world_v2.py** - change the label every second
+ **shoppinglist.py** - button, tableview and textfield use
+ **layout.py** - automatic resize ui elements
+ **pop-over.py** - pop-over view -> Really want to quit?
+ **AreYouEnabledView.py** - advanced example with textfield_did_change, console_alert, speech, ... (written by cclauss)
+ **ShowTableView.py** - directory table, empty table and table with different accessory_types/images
+ **MultipleViews.py** - add and remove views/elements at run time
+ **MultipleViews_v2.py** - get the screen size / orientation // implement did_load and draw
+ **Webbrowser.py** - Basic example of a web browser
+ **SpecialButton.py** - control all touch events (touch_began, _moved, _ended)
+ **segmented-control.py** - Basic example of how to use a segmented control (written by tjferry14)
+ **MyImageView.py** - view all JPGs in the current directory
+ **NavigationViewExample.py** - don't forget `test.pyui` (the subview)
+ **SwitchViews.py** - show and hide complex views (my own NavView ðŸ˜„). Don't forget `test.pyui` and `space.png`
